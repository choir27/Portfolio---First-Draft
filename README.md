# First Draft of my Portfolio

This repo represents my first draft of my portfolio, where the design of this version mostly stays the same with my current version.  Beyond a couple tweeks design wise, the biggest changes were making the code more semantically correct, focusing on a more clean code with the CSS, JS, and HTML.  From this, I learned the core style layout elements that make creating websites more efficient, which I applied to my future projects after my portfolio's second draft.
